Python Basics Assignment – Complete beginner-friendly solutions (20 programs) with proper comments and error handling.

Name: Bindu B  
Assignment: Python Basics Assignment (Modules 1–6)  
Total Questions Attempted: 20/20  

Overview:
This assignment contains solutions for 20 Python programming questions covering fundamental Python concepts 

Approach:
All programs are written using simple and beginner-friendly logic. 
Meaningful and descriptive variable names are used to improve readability. 
Each solution includes clear comments explaining the logic step by step.

Error Handling:
Wherever user input is required, proper error handling is implemented 
using try-except blocks to manage invalid inputs and prevent runtime errors.

Special Features:
- Menu-driven programs for better user interaction.
- Separate functions used wherever required.
- Edge cases handled (division by zero, negative inputs, invalid dates, etc.).
- Clean, structured, and readable code.

Challenges Faced:
Some questions, especially the ATM simulator, number guessing game, text analysis functions, and number system functions, required careful 
logical thinking and proper function structuring. Handling edge cases 
correctly was also an important part of the implementation.

Learning Outcome:
This assignment helped strengthen my understanding of:
- Control flow statements
- Looping concepts
- Function creation and usage
- String manipulation techniques
- Mathematical computations
- Error handling in Python
- Writing structured and maintainable code

All solutions are written independently following the assignment guidelines.
